Because the conclusion holds true in both possible scenarios, it is logically true.","Let's analyze the premises for the individual 'rina'.
1. `DrinkRegularly(rina, coffee) → IsDependentOn(rina, caffeine)`
2. `DrinkRegularly(rina, coffee) ∨ ¬WantToBeAddictedTo(rina, caffeine)`
3. `¬WantToBeAddictedTo(rina, caffeine) → ¬AwareThatDrug(rina, caffeine)`
4. The premise `¬(Student(rina) ⊕ ¬AwareThatDrug(rina, caffeine))` is a negated XOR, which is logically equivalent to an equivalence (XNOR). So, `Student(rina) ↔ ¬AwareThatDrug(rina, caffeine)`.
5. Similarly, `¬(IsDependentOn(rina, caffeine) ⊕ Student(rina))` is equivalent to `IsDependentOn(rina, caffeine) ↔ Student(rina)`.

The conclusion is `¬WantToBeAddictedTo(rina, caffeine) ∨ ¬AwareThatDrug(rina, caffeine)`.

To prove the conclusion, we can use proof by cases based on Premise 2, which states that either Rina drinks coffee regularly or Rina does not want to be addicted to caffeine.

Case 1: Assume `¬WantToBeAddictedTo(rina, caffeine)` is true.
In this case, the conclusion `¬WantToBeAddictedTo(rina, caffeine) ∨ ¬AwareThatDrug(rina, caffeine)` is automatically true because one part of the disjunction (OR statement) is true.

Case 2: Assume `DrinkRegularly(rina, coffee)` is true.
- From Premise 1, if Rina drinks coffee regularly, she is dependent on caffeine (`IsDependentOn(rina, caffeine)` is true).
- From Premise 5, if she is dependent on caffeine, she is a student (`Student(rina)` is true).
- From Premise 4, if she is a student, she is not aware that caffeine is a drug (`¬AwareThatDrug(rina, caffeine)` is true).
- In this case, the conclusion `¬WantToBeAddictedTo(rina, caffeine) ∨ ¬AwareThatDrug(rina, caffeine)` is also true because the second part of the disjunction is true.

Since the conclusion is true in both possible cases derived from the premises, it logically follows from the premises."

Since the second part of this 'or' statement is true in this case, the entire conclusion is true.

Case 2: Rina is not a student.
According to the fifth premise, if she is not a student, she is not dependent on caffeine. From the first premise (All who regularly drink coffee are dependent), this means Rina does not regularly drink coffee. From the second premise (People regularly drink coffee or they don't want to be addicted), since Rina does not regularly drink coffee, it must be true that she doesn't want to be addicted to caffeine. Since the first part of the conclusion's 'or' statement is true in this case, the entire conclusion is true.

Because the conclusion is logically necessary in both possible scenarios, it is true.","Let's denote the propositions for Rina as follows:
R: DrinkRegularly(rina, coffee)
D: IsDependentOn(rina, caffeine)
W: WantToBeAddictedTo(rina, caffeine)
A: AwareThatDrug(rina, caffeine)
S: Student(rina)

The premises can be written as:
1. R → D
2. R ∨ ¬W
3. ¬W → ¬A
4. ¬(S ⊕ ¬A) which is equivalent to S ↔ ¬A (S and ¬A have the same truth value).
5. ¬(D ⊕ S) which is equivalent to D ↔ S (D and S have the same truth value).

The conclusion is: ¬W ⊕ ¬A

From premises 4 and 5, we can deduce D ↔ S ↔ ¬A. This means D, S, and ¬A must all have the same truth value.

Let's test the two possibilities for their truth value:

Case 1: Assume D, S, and ¬A are all False.
- If D is False, from premise 1 (R → D), R must be False.
- If ¬A is False, from premise 3 (¬W → ¬A), ¬W must be False.
- Now we check premise 2 (R ∨ ¬W) with these values: F ∨ F = F. This contradicts premise 2, which must be True. Therefore, this case is impossible.

Case 2: Assume D, S, and ¬A are all True.
- This is the only remaining possibility. So, we can deduce that ¬A is True.
- The conclusion is ¬W ⊕ ¬A. Since ¬A is True, the conclusion becomes ¬W ⊕ True.
- For the conclusion to be logically true, it must be true in all valid scenarios. The truth of ¬W ⊕ True depends on the value of ¬W. If ¬W is False, the conclusion is True. If ¬W is True, the conclusion is False.
- Let's see if the premises force a specific value for ¬W. The remaining premises to satisfy are:
  - R → D becomes R → True (always satisfied).
  - R ∨ ¬W must be True.
  - ¬W → ¬A becomes ¬W → True (always satisfied).
- The only constraint left is that (R ∨ ¬W) must be True. This does not force ¬W to be False. We can construct a model where all premises are true, but the conclusion is false.
- Counterexample Model: Let ¬W = True. To satisfy (R ∨ ¬W), we can choose any value for R (e.g., R=False). So, let's set D=T, S=T, ¬A=T, ¬W=T, R=F. All premises are satisfied with this model. 
- In this model, the conclusion ¬W ⊕ ¬A becomes T ⊕ T, which is False.

Since we have found a valid model where all premises are true but the conclusion is false, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises."

We can do this by trying to find a scenario where all premises are true but the conclusion is false.

Let's assume the conclusion ""Rina either regularly drinks coffee or is unaware that caffeine is a drug"" is False. This means both parts must be false: 
1. Rina does NOT regularly drink coffee.
2. Rina is NOT unaware that caffeine is a drug (i.e., she IS aware).

Now, let's check if this scenario is consistent with the premises:
- If Rina is aware that caffeine is a drug, then from the fourth premise (""Rina is either a student who is unaware... or she is not a student and is... aware""), Rina must NOT be a student.
- If Rina is not a student, then from the fifth premise (""Rina is either a student who is dependent... or she is not a student and not dependent""), Rina is NOT dependent on caffeine.
- The first premise (""All people who regularly drink coffee are dependent on caffeine"") is consistent. Rina does not regularly drink coffee and is not dependent.
- The third premise (""No one who doesn't want to be addicted to caffeine is unaware that caffeine is a drug"") means if someone is aware, we can't be sure if they want to be addicted or not. However, we can use the second premise to figure this out.
- The second premise (""People regularly drink coffee, or they don't want to be addicted to caffeine"") requires at least one part to be true. Since we established Rina does not regularly drink coffee, she must NOT want to be addicted to caffeine.
- Now, let's re-check the third premise. Rina doesn't want to be addicted, and the premise says such a person is not unaware that caffeine is a drug. This is consistent with our initial assumption that Rina is aware.

We have successfully constructed a scenario where all premises are true, but the conclusion is false. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.","Let's use the following predicates for the individual 'rina':
DR = DrinkRegularly(rina, coffee)
ID = IsDependentOn(rina, caffeine)
WTA = WantToBeAddictedTo(rina, caffeine)
AD = AwareThatDrug(rina, caffeine)
S = Student(rina)

The premises for rina can be written as:
1.  DR → ID
2.  DR ∨ ¬WTA (which is equivalent to ¬DR → ¬WTA)
3.  ¬WTA → ¬AD
4.  ¬(S ⊕ ¬AD) (which is equivalent to S ↔ ¬AD)
5.  ¬(ID ⊕ S) (which is equivalent to ID ↔ S)

The conclusion to evaluate is: DR ⊕ ¬AD

First, let's deduce some facts from the premises:
- From premise 4 (S ↔ ¬AD) and premise 5 (ID ↔ S), we can establish a transitive relationship: ID ↔ S ↔ ¬AD. This means ID ↔ ¬AD.

Now, let's consider two cases based on whether Rina drinks coffee regularly (DR) or not (¬DR).

Case 1: Assume DR is True.
- From premise 1 (DR → ID), since DR is True, ID must be True.
- Since ID is True and we know ID ↔ ¬AD, then ¬AD must also be True.
- So, if DR is True, then ¬AD is True.

Case 2: Assume DR is False (¬DR is True).
- From premise 2 (¬DR → ¬WTA), since ¬DR is True, ¬WTA must be True.
- From premise 3 (¬WTA → ¬AD), since ¬WTA is True, ¬AD must also be True.
- So, if DR is False, then ¬AD is True.

In both possible cases, ¬AD (Rina is unaware that caffeine is a drug) must be True. This is a necessary conclusion from the premises.

Now, let's evaluate the conclusion: DR ⊕ ¬AD.
Since we have established that ¬AD is True, the conclusion simplifies to: DR ⊕ True.
The XOR (⊕) operator is true only when its operands have different truth values. 
- If DR is True, the conclusion is True ⊕ True, which is False.
- If DR is False, the conclusion is False ⊕ True, which is True.

So, the truth value of the conclusion depends on the truth value of DR.

Can we determine the truth value of DR from the premises? We know ¬AD is True, which implies S is True (from premise 4) and ID is True (from premise 5). Let's check these facts against the other premises:
- Premise 1: DR → ID becomes DR → True. This statement is always true, regardless of the value of DR. It does not constrain DR.
- Premise 2: DR ∨ ¬WTA. This does not determine DR.
- Premise 3: ¬WTA → ¬AD becomes ¬WTA → True. This is always true and does not constrain ¬WTA or DR.

The premises do not provide enough information to determine whether Rina drinks coffee regularly (DR) or not. Since the conclusion's truth value depends on DR, and DR's value cannot be determined, the truth of the conclusion is uncertain."

Let C = Rina regularly drinks coffee.
Let A = Rina doesn't want to be addicted to caffeine.
Let U = Rina is unaware that caffeine is a drug.
Let D = Rina is dependent on caffeine.
Let S = Rina is a student.

Premises:
1. C -> D (If Rina regularly drinks coffee, she is dependent on caffeine.)
2. C v A (Rina regularly drinks coffee or she doesn't want to be addicted.)
3. A -> ~U (If Rina doesn't want to be addicted, she is not unaware that caffeine is a drug.)
4. (S & U) v (~S & ~U) which is equivalent to S <-> U.
5. (S & D) v (~S & ~D) which is equivalent to S <-> D.

Derivations from Premises:
- From (4) and (5), by transitivity, we get U <-> D. (Rina is unaware if and only if she is dependent).
- From (1), C -> D. Since D <-> U, we can substitute to get C -> U.
- From (3), we have A -> ~U. The contrapositive is U -> ~A.
- We can now form a chain of implications: C -> U -> ~A. This means C -> ~A.
- Now we have two key statements: C -> ~A (derived) and C v A (premise 2). The only way both can be true is if C and A always have opposite truth values. Therefore, A <-> ~C.

Conclusion: ""If Rina either doesn't want to be addicted to caffeine and is unaware that caffeine is a drug, or neither doesn't want to be addicted to caffeine nor is unaware that caffeine is a drug, then Rina doesn't want to be addicted to caffeine and regularly drinks coffee.""
- Symbolically, this is: ((A & U) v (~A & ~U)) -> (A & C).
- This simplifies to: (A <-> U) -> (A & C).

Analyzing the conclusion:
- Antecedent (the 'if' part): A <-> U. We know from premise 3 (A -> ~U) and its contrapositive (U -> ~A) that A and U must have opposite truth values (A <-> ~U). Therefore, the statement A <-> U is always False.
- Consequent (the 'then' part): A & C. We derived that A and C must have opposite truth values (A <-> ~C). Therefore, the statement A & C is always False.

The entire conclusion is an implication of the form (False) -> (False). In logic, any implication with a false antecedent is considered True. Therefore, the conclusion is logically true.","Let's denote the predicates as follows:
DR(x): DrinkRegularly(x, coffee)
ID(x): IsDependentOn(x, caffeine)
WA(x): WantToBeAddictedTo(x, caffeine)
AD(x): AwareThatDrug(x, caffeine)
S(x): Student(x)
r: rina

The premises for rina are:
1. DR(r) → ID(r)
2. DR(r) ∨ ¬WA(r)
3. ¬WA(r) → ¬AD(r)
4. ¬(S(r) ⊕ ¬AD(r))  This is equivalent to an XNOR, meaning S(r) and ¬AD(r) have the same truth value: S(r) ↔ ¬AD(r).
5. ¬(ID(r) ⊕ S(r))  This is also equivalent to an XNOR, meaning ID(r) and S(r) have the same truth value: ID(r) ↔ S(r).

From premises 4 and 5, by transitivity, we get: ID(r) ↔ S(r) ↔ ¬AD(r). This means all three propositions must have the same truth value.

Let's test the two possible scenarios:
Scenario 1: ID(r), S(r), and ¬AD(r) are all FALSE.
- If ID(r) is False, then from premise 1 (DR(r) → ID(r)), we can conclude that DR(r) must be False (by modus tollens).
- If ¬AD(r) is False, then from premise 3 (¬WA(r) → ¬AD(r)), we can conclude that ¬WA(r) must be False (by modus tollens).
- Now let's check premise 2 (DR(r) ∨ ¬WA(r)). Substituting our findings, we get (False ∨ False), which is False. This contradicts premise 2, which must be true. Therefore, Scenario 1 is impossible.

Scenario 2: ID(r), S(r), and ¬AD(r) are all TRUE.
- This scenario does not lead to any contradictions with the premises. Thus, we can deduce from the premises that ¬AD(r) is definitively TRUE.

Now let's analyze the conclusion: (¬WA(r) ⊕ ¬AD(r)) → ¬(¬WA(r) ∧ DR(r))
- Let's substitute the known fact that ¬AD(r) is TRUE into the conclusion.
- The antecedent becomes (¬WA(r) ⊕ True). The result of an XOR with True is the negation of the other operand. So, (¬WA(r) ⊕ True) is equivalent to ¬(¬WA(r)), which simplifies to WA(r).
- The consequent is ¬(¬WA(r) ∧ DR(r)). By De Morgan's laws, this is equivalent to (¬(¬WA(r)) ∨ ¬DR(r)), which simplifies to (WA(r) ∨ ¬DR(r)).

So, the entire conclusion simplifies to: WA(r) → (WA(r) ∨ ¬DR(r)).
This logical structure, p → (p ∨ q), is a tautology. It is always true, regardless of the truth values of WA(r) and DR(r). Since the conclusion is a tautology, it is logically true given the premises."

Premise 7 (`Eel(seaEel) ∨ Animal(seaEel) ∨ ¬Plant(seaEel)`) would then simplify to `Eel(seaEel)`. If `Eel(seaEel)` is true, then by Premise 1, `Fish(seaEel)` is true. By Premise 2, `¬Plant(seaEel)` would be true. This contradicts our assumption that `seaEel` is a Plant. Therefore, this assumption is false.
3. The only other possibility from step 1 is that `seaEel` is an Animal (`Animal(seaEel)` is true) and not a Plant (`¬Plant(seaEel)` is true). This case is consistent with all premises.
4. We have `DisplayedIn(seaEel, collection)` (Premise 6) and `Animal(seaEel)` (from our deduction in step 3).
5. According to Premise 5, `∀x (DisplayedIn(x, collection) ∧ Animal(x) → Multicellular(x))`. Therefore, we can conclude `Multicellular(seaEel)` is true.
6. The conclusion is `Multicellular(seaEel) ∨ Bacteria(seaEel)`. Since we have proven `Multicellular(seaEel)` is true, the entire disjunction is logically true, regardless of the truth value of `Bacteria(seaEel)`."

We want to check if the conclusion ""The monitor L-2021 is either in the library or produced by LG"" must be true.

Let's assume the conclusion is false. This would mean that ""The L-2021 monitor is NOT in the library AND it is NOT produced by LG.""

1.  If the L-2021 is not produced by LG, then according to the fifth premise (""The L-2021 monitor is either both produced before 2010 and made by LG, or neither is true""), it must also be true that the L-2021 was NOT produced before 2010.
2.  If the L-2021 is not in the library, then according to the fourth premise (""The L-2021 monitor is either used in the library or has a type-c port""), it must be true that the L-2021 has a type-c port.

So, if the conclusion is false, it means the L-2021 has a type-c port and was not produced before 2010. Let's check if this scenario contradicts any other premises.

*   The premise ""Monitors that have a type-c port were not made before 2010"" is consistent with this scenario.
*   The premise ""All monitors in the library are made before 2010"" is also not contradicted, as our scenario states the L-2021 is not in the library.

Since we have found a valid scenario where all the premises hold true but the conclusion is false, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.","Let's analyze the premises step-by-step for the monitor `l-2021`:
1. From `Monitor(l-2021) ∧ (In(l-2021, library) ⊕ Have(l-2021, typeCPort))`, we know `l-2021` is either in the library or has a Type-C port, but not both. This creates two possibilities.
2. From `¬(ProducedBefore(l-2021, yr2010) ⊕ ProducedBy(l-2021, lG))`, we know that `ProducedBefore(l-2021, yr2010)` and `ProducedBy(l-2021, lG)` must have the same truth value (either both are true or both are false). This is because the negation of XOR is equivalent to logical biconditional (↔).
3. Let's consider the two possibilities from premise 1:
   - **Case A: `l-2021` is in the library.** If it's in the library, the premise `∀x ((Monitor(x) ∧ In(x, library)) → ProducedBefore(x, yr2010))` implies it *was* produced before 2010. Based on point 2, if it was produced before 2010, it must also have been produced by LG. So, in this case, both `In(l-2021, library)` and `ProducedBy(l-2021, lG)` are true.
   - **Case B: `l-2021` has a Type-C port.** If it has a Type-C port, the premise `∀x (Have(x, typeCPort) → ¬ProducedBefore(x, yr2010))` implies it was *not* produced before 2010. Based on point 2, if it was not produced before 2010, it must also *not* have been produced by LG. So, in this case, both `In(l-2021, library)` and `ProducedBy(l-2021, lG)` are false.
4. The conclusion is `In(l-2021, library) ⊕ ProducedBy(l-2021, lG)`. This expression (XOR) is true only if one statement is true and the other is false.
5. In Case A, both statements are true, so `True ⊕ True` is False.

Case 2: The L-2021 monitor has a type-c port. 
In either case, at least one condition of the conclusion ('has a type-c port' or 'is produced by LG') is met.

The `⊕` (XOR) means exactly one of `In(l-2021, library)` or `Have(l-2021, typeCPort)` is true. This gives us two cases.
Premise 5 states `¬(ProducedBefore(l-2021, yr2010) ⊕ ProducedBy(l-2021, lG))`. A negated XOR is equivalent to an XNOR (if and only if), meaning `ProducedBefore(l-2021, yr2010)` and `ProducedBy(l-2021, lG)` must have the same truth value.

Case 1: `In(l-2021, library)` is True and `Have(l-2021, typeCPort)` is False.
- From Premise 3 (`(Monitor(x) ∧ In(x, library)) → ProducedBefore(x, yr2010)`), since l-2021 is a monitor in the library, `ProducedBefore(l-2021, yr2010)` must be True.
- From Premise 5, since `ProducedBefore(l-2021, yr2010)` is True, `ProducedBy(l-2021, lG)` must also be True.
- We evaluate the conclusion `Have(l-2021, typeCPort) ⊕ ProducedBy(l-2021, lG)` with our findings: `False ⊕ True`, which is True.

Case 2: `In(l-2021, library)` is False and `Have(l-2021, typeCPort)` is True.
- From Premise 2 (`Have(x, typeCPort) → ¬ProducedBefore(x, yr2010)`), since l-2021 has a type C port, `¬ProducedBefore(l-2021, yr2010)` is True. This means `ProducedBefore(l-2021, yr2010)` is False.
- From Premise 5, since `ProducedBefore(l-2021, yr2010)` is False, `ProducedBy(l-2021, lG)` must also be False.

1. From the premises, if a monitor is in the library, it was made before 2010. If a monitor was made before 2010, it does not have a type-c port. Therefore, if the L-2021 is in the library, it does not have a type-c port. 
2. We are told the L-2021 is *either* in the library or has a type-c port. Based on point 1, these two conditions are mutually exclusive. This creates two possible scenarios for the L-2021.
3. We are also told the L-2021 is either both made before 2010 and by LG, or neither. This means being made before 2010 is equivalent to being made by LG for this specific monitor.

Scenario A: The L-2021 is in the library. 
- It does not have a type-c port. 
- It was made before 2010. 
- Therefore, it is made by LG.

Scenario B: The L-2021 has a type-c port. 
- It is not in the library. 
- It was not made before 2010. 
- Therefore, it is not made by LG.

Now let's evaluate the conclusion: ""If the L-2021 monitor is either in the library and produced by LG, or neither in the library nor produced by LG, then L-2021 neither has a type-c port nor is produced by LG.""

Let's test the 'if' part (antecedent) in both scenarios:
- In Scenario A, L-2021 is in the library and made by LG. The antecedent is TRUE.
- In Scenario B, L-2021 is not in the library and not made by LG. The antecedent is TRUE.
So, in both possible scenarios, the 'if' part of the conclusion is true.

Now let's test the 'then' part (consequent) in both scenarios:
- In Scenario A, L-2021 does not have a type-c port, but it *is* produced by LG. The consequent (""neither has a type-c port nor is produced by LG"") is FALSE.
- In Scenario B, L-2021 *has* a type-c port and is not produced by LG. The consequent is FALSE.

In both possible scenarios, the antecedent is true and the consequent is false. An implication (if P then Q) is false when P is true and Q is false. Since this is the case here, the conclusion is logically false.","The conclusion contains a free variable 'x', making it an ill-formed proposition. To evaluate it, we must assume 'x' is a typo and should refer to 'l-2021'. Let's analyze the state of l-2021 based on the premises.

From premise 4, we have two mutually exclusive cases for l-2021:
1.  `In(l-2021, library)` is True and `Have(l-2021, typeCPort)` is False.
2.  `In(l-2021, library)` is False and `Have(l-2021, typeCPort)` is True.

From premise 5, `¬(ProducedBefore(l-2021, yr2010) ⊕ ProducedBy(l-2021, lG))` is equivalent to `ProducedBefore(l-2021, yr2010) ↔ ProducedBy(l-2021, lG)`. This means these two statements are either both true or both false.

Let's follow the implications for each case:
- In Case 1: `In(l-2021, library)` is True. By premise 3, `ProducedBefore(l-2021, yr2010)` is True. Therefore, by premise 5, `ProducedBy(l-2021, lG)` must also be True.
- In Case 2: `Have(l-2021, typeCPort)` is True. By premise 2, `¬ProducedBefore(l-2021, yr2010)` is True. Therefore, by premise 5, `ProducedBy(l-2021, lG)` must be False.

Now we evaluate the modified conclusion: `¬(In(l-2021, library) ⊕ ProducedBy(l-2021, lG)) → (¬Have(l-2021, typeCPort) ∧ ¬ProducedBy(l-2021, lG))`

The antecedent `¬(In(l-2021, library) ⊕ ProducedBy(l-2021, lG))` is equivalent to `In(l-2021, library) ↔ ProducedBy(l-2021, lG)`.

- Test Case 1: `In(l-2021, library)` is True and `ProducedBy(l-2021, lG)` is True. The antecedent is `True ↔ True`, which is True. The consequent is `¬(False) ∧ ¬(True)`, which is `True ∧ False`, resulting in False. The whole implication is `True → False`, which is False.
- Test Case 2: `In(l-2021, library)` is False and `ProducedBy(l-2021, lG)` is False. The antecedent is `False ↔ False`, which is True. The consequent is `¬(True) ∧ ¬(False)`, which is `False ∧ True`, resulting in False. The whole implication is `True → False`, which is False.

Since the conclusion is false in all possible scenarios consistent with the premises, it is logically false."

The 'then' part is: ""L-2021 is either in the library or produced by LG.""

Let's analyze the premises to see if this must be true.
1. From Premise 4, L-2021 is either in the library or has a type-c port.
2. Let's consider the case where L-2021 has a type-c port and is not in the library. This satisfies Premise 4.
3. If it has a type-c port, then from Premise 2, it was not made before 2010.
4. Premise 5 states that being made before 2010 and being made by LG are either both true or both false. Since it was not made before 2010, it also must not be made by LG.
5. So, we have a valid scenario where L-2021 is not in the library and not made by LG. In this scenario, the 'then' part of the conclusion (""L-2021 is either in the library or produced by LG"") is false.

Since we have found a scenario consistent with all premises where the 'if' part of the conclusion is true but the 'then' part is false, the overall conclusion is logically false.","The conclusion is an implication of the form A → B.

Premise 4 states that no planets gravitationally bound by the Sun are rogue planets. This means the state of being 'both a rogue planet and a planet gravitationally bound by the Sun' is impossible. Now consider Premise 6: 'If PSO J318.5−22 is not both a rogue planet and a planet gravitationally bound by the Sun, then it is a rogue planet.' Since the 'if' condition is always true (as the described state is impossible), the 'then' condition must also be true. Therefore, we can deduce that PSO J318.5−22 is a rogue planet. From the contrapositive of Premise 4, if a planet is a rogue planet, it is not gravitationally bound by the Sun. Thus, PSO J318.5−22 is not gravitationally bound by the Sun. From Premise 3, everything in the solar system is gravitationally bound by the Sun. Since PSO J318.5−22 is not gravitationally bound by the Sun, it cannot be in the solar system. According to Premise 1, it must be outside the solar system. Finally, Premise 2 states that nothing outside the solar system has the Sun as its star. Since PSO J318.5−22 is outside the solar system, it does not have the Sun as its star. The conclusion is an 'or' statement: 'PSO J318.5−22 is an orphan planet or it does not have the Sun as its star'.

From Premise 4, (P ∧ B) → ¬(P ∧ R). Since we know (P ∧ R) is true, ¬(P ∧ R) is false. For the implication to hold, the antecedent (P ∧ B) must be false. Since P is true, B must be false.

The conclusion is (Planet(pSOJ318.5-22) ∧ Orphan(pSOJ318.5-22)) ∨ ¬SunAs(pSOJ318.5-22, star).

Let R be 'PSO J318.5−22 is a rogue planet' and G be 'PSO J318.5−22 is gravitationally bound by the Sun'. Premise 6 is `¬(R ∧ G) → R`. This is logically equivalent to `(R ∧ G) ∨ R`, which simplifies to `R`. Therefore, PSO J318.5−22 is a rogue planet.
2. From Premise 4, if a planet is gravitationally bound by the Sun, it is not a rogue planet (`G → ¬R`). Since we know PSO J318.5−22 is a rogue planet (R is true, so ¬R is false), by modus tollens we can conclude it is not gravitationally bound by the Sun (¬G is true).
3. From Premise 3, if something is in the solar system, it is gravitationally bound by the Sun (`S → G`). Since we know ¬G, by modus tollens we conclude it is not in the solar system (¬S is true).
4. From Premise 1, everything is either outside or inside the solar system. Since PSO J318.5−22 is not in the solar system, it must be outside the solar system (O is true).
5. From Premise 2, nothing outside the solar system has the Sun as its star (`O → ¬H`). Since we know PSO J318.5−22 is outside the solar system, we can conclude it does not have the Sun as its star (¬H is true).
6. The conclusion is: ""If (PSO J318.5−22 is an orphan planet OR it does not have the Sun as the star), THEN (PSO J318.5−22 is not an orphan planet AND it does have the Sun as the star).""
7. Let's analyze the 'IF' part of the conclusion: `(is an orphan planet ∨ does not have the Sun as the star)`. We established in step 5 that 'does not have the Sun as the star' is True. Therefore, the entire 'IF' clause is True, because `(Anything ∨ True)` is always True.
8. Let's analyze the 'THEN' part of the conclusion: `(is not an orphan planet ∧ does have the Sun as the star)`. We established in step 5 that 'does not have the Sun as the star' is True, which means 'does have the Sun as the star' is False. Therefore, the entire 'THEN' clause is False, because `(Anything ∧ False)` is always False.
9. The conclusion has the logical structure `True → False`, which is always logically False.","Let A be 'Planet(pSOJ318.5-22) ∧ Orphan(pSOJ318.5-22)' and B be '¬SunAs(pSOJ318.5-22, star)'. The conclusion has the form (A ∨ B) → (¬A ∧ B).

From the premises, we can deduce that B is True:
1. Premise 6, '¬(Planet(p) ∧ Rogue(p) ∧ BoundBy(p)) → (Planet(p) ∧ Rogue(p))', simplifies by logical equivalence to '(Planet(p) ∧ Rogue(p))'. Thus, 'Planet(p)' is true and 'Rogue(p)' is true.
2. From Premise 4, 'Planet(p) ∧ BoundBy(p) → ¬(Planet(p) ∧ Rogue(p))'. Since we know 'Planet(p)' is true and 'Planet(p) ∧ Rogue(p)' is true, this premise becomes 'BoundBy(p) → False', which means '¬BoundBy(p)' must be true.
3. From Premise 3, 'In(p, solarSystem) → BoundBy(p)'. By modus tollens with '¬BoundBy(p)', we get '¬In(p, solarSystem)'.
4. From Premise 1, 'Outside(p, solarSystem) ⊕ In(p, solarSystem)'. Since '¬In(p, solarSystem)' is true, 'Outside(p, solarSystem)' must be true.
5. From Premise 2, 'Outside(p, solarSystem) → ¬SunAs(p, star)'. By modus ponens with 'Outside(p, solarSystem)', we get '¬SunAs(p, star)'. Therefore, B is True.

Substituting B=True into the conclusion '(A ∨ B) → (¬A ∧ B)' gives '(A ∨ True) → (¬A ∧ True)', which simplifies to 'True → ¬A', which is logically equivalent to '¬A'.

So, the conclusion is equivalent to '¬(Planet(pSOJ318.5-22) ∧ Orphan(pSOJ318.5-22))'. Since we already deduced 'Planet(p)' is true, the conclusion's truth depends entirely on '¬Orphan(p)'.

The premises do not allow us to determine the truth value of 'Orphan(p)'. Premise 5, 'Planet(p) ∧ Orphan(p) → Planet(p) ∧ Rogue(p)', is the only one mentioning 'Orphan', and it becomes 'Orphan(p) → True' given our deductions, which is a tautology and provides no information about 'Orphan(p)'.

Because the truth of the conclusion depends on 'Orphan(p)', which is undetermined, we can construct a valid model where the premises are true and the conclusion is false. Let 'Orphan(p)' be true. All premises hold. In this case, A is true, and the conclusion (which is equivalent to ¬A) is false. Since a conclusion is only logically true if it must follow from the premises in all cases, and we have found a counterexample, the conclusion is not logically true."

4. There are two possibilities for TikTok based on the premises:
   a) TikTok has chat features. If this is true, the first part of the conclusion is met, making the entire statement true.
   b) TikTok does not have chat features. If this is true, then it must have video features. However, the premises do not state that social media applications with video features are software or computer programs. 
5. In the second scenario (where TikTok does not have chat features), it is impossible to determine from the given information whether or not it is a computer program. If it is not a computer program, the conclusion (""TikTok either has chat features or is a computer program"") would be false.
6. Since the conclusion can be true under one valid scenario but false under another valid scenario, its truth cannot be determined from the premises alone.","Let P be the statement `Contain(tikTok, chatFeature)` and Q be the statement `ComputerProgram(tikTok)`. The conclusion is `P ⊕ Q` (P XOR Q), which is true if and only if P and Q have different truth values.

From the premises, we can establish a relationship between P and Q:
1.  Premise 1 states: `∀x (SocialMedia(x) ∧ Application(x) ∧ Contain(x, chatFeature) → Software(x))`. For x=tikTok, this simplifies to `P → Software(tikTok)` because we are given `SocialMedia(tikTok)` and `Application(tikTok)`.
2.  Premise 5 states: `∀x (SocialMedia(x) ∧ Application(x) ∧ Software(x) → ComputerProgram(x))`. For x=tikTok, this simplifies to `Software(tikTok) → Q`.
3.  By the law of hypothetical syllogism (transitivity) on statements 1 and 2, we can conclude that `P → Q`.

The statement `P → Q` means that it is not possible for P to be True while Q is False.

Now let's evaluate the conclusion `P ⊕ Q`:
- If P is True, then Q must be True (due to `P → Q`). In this case, `P ⊕ Q` (True ⊕ True) is False.
- If P is False, the statement `P → Q` is true regardless of the truth value of Q. The premises do not give us any other way to determine if tikTok is a `ComputerProgram`. Thus, Q could be either True or False.
    - If P is False and Q is False, then `P ⊕ Q` (False ⊕ False) is False.
    - If P is False and Q is True, then `P ⊕ Q` (False ⊕ True) is True.

Since we can construct scenarios consistent with the premises where the conclusion `P ⊕ Q` is False and another scenario where it is True, the truth of the conclusion cannot be determined from the premises alone."

From the premises, we can chain the following logic: If Susan is a Yale student, then she is a college student (P3), which means she is a young adult (P2), which means she likes independence (P1). So, if Susan is a Yale student, she likes independence. However, another premise (P8) states that if Susan is a Yale student, then she does not like independence. These two statements create a logical contradiction. The only way for the set of premises to be consistent is if the condition 'Susan is a Yale student' is false. Therefore, Susan is not a Yale student. 

We know Susan is at the event (P6) and that everyone at the event is either a Yale student or a Harvard student (P4). Since we have deduced Susan is not a Yale student, she must be a Harvard student. 

Now, let's see what follows from Susan being a Harvard student. Because she is a Harvard student, she is diligent (P5). The premises also state that if Susan is a Harvard student, then she is a young adult (P7). Because she is a young adult, she likes independence (P1). 

Therefore, based on the premises, we can deduce that Susan is both diligent AND she likes independence. The conclusion states that 'Susan is not both diligent and likes independence,' which is the direct opposite of what we have logically deduced. Thus, the conclusion is false.","1.

From Premise 1, she `Like(susan, independence)`. However, Premise 7 states that if she is a Yale student, then `¬Like(susan, independence)`. This is a contradiction. 4. Therefore, the assumption that Susan is a Yale student must be false. 5. Since she is not a Yale student, she must be a Harvard student (`HarvardStudent(susan)` is true). 6.

If Amy is a Nobel laureate, she must be a full-time scientist. If she is a full-time scientist, she does not spend the majority of her time on sports. Therefore, if Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner, she does not spend the majority of her time on sports. However, other premises state that if Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner, she is a professional athlete, and all professional athletes spend most of their time on sports. This creates a direct contradiction. The only way to resolve this contradiction is if the initial assumption is false. Therefore, Amy cannot be an Olympic gold medal winner. This makes the second part of the conclusion true. Now, let's look at the premise 'Amy spends the most time on sports, or Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner'. Since we have established she is not an Olympic gold medal winner, she must spend the most time on sports. The premise 'No full-time scientists spend the majority of their time on sports' means that if someone spends the majority of their time on sports, they are not a full-time scientist. Since Amy spends most of her time on sports, she cannot be a full-time scientist. This makes the first part of the conclusion true.

The final premise states 'If Amy is not a Nobel physics laureate, then Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner'. The contrapositive of this is 'If Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel physics laureate'. Let's assume Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner. From the premises, this implies she is a professional athlete who spends most of her time on sports. However, being a Nobel physics laureate implies she is a full-time scientist, and no full-time scientist spends the majority of their time on sports. This creates a contradiction. Therefore, the initial assumption must be false: Amy cannot be an Olympic gold medal winner. 

So, 'Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner' is a fact derived from the premises. Now, let's use this fact. The fifth premise states 'Amy spends the most time on sports, or Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner'. Since we know she is not an Olympic winner, she must spend the most time on sports. The third premise says no full-time scientists spend the majority of their time on sports. This means Amy cannot be a full-time scientist. The fourth premise says all Nobel physics laureates are full-time scientists. Since Amy is not a full-time scientist, she cannot be a Nobel physics laureate.

The conclusion is: 'If Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel physics laureate.' We have established that the 'if' part ('Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner') is true, and the 'then' part ('Amy is a Nobel physics laureate') is false. An 'if-then' statement where the 'if' part is true and the 'then' part is false is logically false.","Let's analyze the premises step-by-step. First, we can establish two logical chains:
1. From `OlympicGoldMedalWinner(x) → ProfessionalAthlete(x)` and `ProfessionalAthlete(x) → SpendOn(x, mostOfTheirTime, sports)`, we can deduce `OlympicGoldMedalWinner(x) → SpendOn(x, mostOfTheirTime, sports)`. Let's call this (A).
2. From `NobelPhysicsLaureate(x) → FullTimeScientist(x)` and `FullTimeScientist(x) → ¬SpendOn(x, mostOfTheirTime, sports)`, we can deduce `NobelPhysicsLaureate(x) → ¬SpendOn(x, mostOfTheirTime, sports)`. The contrapositive of this is `SpendOn(x, mostOfTheirTime, sports) → ¬NobelPhysicsLaureate(x)`. Let's call this (B).

Now, let's use the premises specific to Amy:
3. We are given `¬NobelPhysicsLaureate(amy) → ¬OlympicGoldMedalWinner(amy)`. The contrapositive of this statement is `OlympicGoldMedalWinner(amy) → NobelPhysicsLaureate(amy)`.
4. If we combine this with chain (A) and (B), we create a contradiction. If Amy were an Olympic Gold Medal Winner, she would be a Nobel Laureate (from step 3), which means she would NOT spend most of her time on sports (from chain B). But being an Olympic Gold Medal Winner also means she DOES spend most of her time on sports (from chain A). Since this is a contradiction, the initial assumption must be false. Therefore, we can conclude that `¬OlympicGoldMedalWinner(amy)` is True.

Now let's evaluate the conclusion: `¬OlympicGoldMedalWinner(amy) → NobelPhysicsLaureate(amy)`.
5. The antecedent of this implication, `¬OlympicGoldMedalWinner(amy)`, is True (as established in step 4).
6. For the entire implication to be true, the consequent, `NobelPhysicsLaureate(amy)`, must also be true.
7. Let's determine the truth value of `NobelPhysicsLaureate(amy)`. We are given `SpendOn(amy, mostOfTheirTime, sports) ∨ OlympicGoldMedalWinner(amy)`. Since we know `¬OlympicGoldMedalWinner(amy)` is true, `SpendOn(amy, mostOfTheirTime, sports)` must be true.
8. Using chain (B) (`SpendOn(amy, mostOfTheirTime, sports) → ¬NobelPhysicsLaureate(amy)`) and the fact that `SpendOn(amy, mostOfTheirTime, sports)` is true, we can conclude that `¬NobelPhysicsLaureate(amy)` is true. This means `NobelPhysicsLaureate(amy)` is False.

9. Therefore, the conclusion `¬OlympicGoldMedalWinner(amy) → NobelPhysicsLaureate(amy)` evaluates to `True → False`, which is logically False."

If they are red fruits that grow in Ben's yard (which they do), then they must contain Vitamin C (first premise). If they contain Vitamin C and grow in Ben's yard, they must be healthy (third premise). This creates a contradiction: assuming the cherries are not healthy leads to the conclusion that they are healthy. Therefore, the initial assumption that 'the cherries are not apples AND not healthy' must be false. This means that the cherries must be either apples OR healthy (or both). The premises do not provide enough information to rule out the possibility that the cherries are healthy but not apples. Since the conclusion is not a necessary consequence of the premises, it is logically false.","Let's analyze the premises to see what can be definitively proven. Premise 6 is ¬(Healthy(cherry) ∧ Is(cherry, apple)) → RedFruit(cherry). This is logically equivalent to (Healthy(cherry) ∧ Is(cherry, apple)) ∨ RedFruit(cherry). Now let's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that RedFruit(cherry) is false. This would mean that (Healthy(cherry) ∧ Is(cherry, apple)) must be true, which implies Is(cherry, apple) is true. However, premise 2 states that if something is an apple and grown in Ben's yard, it must be a red fruit. Since we know GrownIn(cherry, benSYard) (premise 5) and we just deduced Is(cherry, apple), it follows that RedFruit(cherry) must be true. This contradicts our assumption. Therefore, RedFruit(cherry) must be true. Given that RedFruit(cherry) is true and GrownIn(cherry, benSYard) is true, we can deduce from premise 1 that Contain(cherry, vitaminC) is true, and from premise 3 that Healthy(cherry) is true. Now we know Healthy(cherry) is true. Let's revisit premise 6: ¬(True ∧ Is(cherry, apple)) → True. This simplifies to ¬Is(cherry, apple) → True, which is a tautology (it's always true regardless of whether Is(cherry, apple) is true or false). Similarly, premise 2 becomes (True ∧ Is(cherry, apple)) → True, which is also a tautology. No premise forces a specific truth value for Is(cherry, apple). The premises are consistent with the cherry being an apple, and also consistent with it not being an apple. Therefore, the conclusion cannot be logically determined."

","Contain(cherry, vitaminC) ⊕ On(cherry, warningList)",True,True,False,"To evaluate the conclusion, we can try to assume its opposite is true and see if that creates a contradiction with the premises. Let's assume the conclusion is false. This means two things are true simultaneously: (1) The cherries do NOT contain any Vitamin C, and (2) The cherries are NOT on a warning list. 

From premise 1, if a red fruit grows in Ben's yard, it has Vitamin C. Since we are assuming the cherries do not have Vitamin C (and they grow in Ben's yard), they cannot be red fruits. 

Now, consider premise 6: ""If cherries are not apples and are not healthy, then they are red fruits."" The contrapositive of this is: ""If cherries are NOT red fruits, then they are either apples or they are healthy."" Since we just established the cherries are not red fruits, they must be either apples or healthy.

Could they be apples? No. Premise 2 states all apples in the yard are red fruits. Since the cherries are not red fruits, they cannot be apples.

Therefore, they must be healthy. Does this create a contradiction? Let's check. If the cherries are healthy, premise 4 says they are not on a warning list. This is consistent with our initial assumption (2). No other premise is violated by the cherries being healthy but not containing Vitamin C (premise 3 only states that fruits with Vitamin C are healthy, not the other way around).

Since we have constructed a valid scenario where all premises hold true, but the conclusion is false (a scenario where cherries are healthy, not on a warning list, and don't have Vitamin C), the conclusion is not logically necessary.","Let's analyze the premises to determine the truth values of `Contain(cherry, vitaminC)` and `On(cherry, warningList)`. The conclusion is an exclusive OR (XOR), which is true if and only if exactly one of its arguments is true.

1.  Let's assume `¬RedFruit(cherry)` is true to see if it leads to a contradiction.
2.  From premise 6, `¬(Healthy(cherry) ∧ Is(cherry, apple)) → RedFruit(cherry)`, by modus tollens with our assumption, we must conclude `Healthy(cherry) ∧ Is(cherry, apple)`. This means `Is(cherry, apple)` must be true.
3.  From premise 2, `∀x (GrownIn(x, benSYard) ∧ Is(x, apple) → RedFruit(x))`. We can instantiate this for the cherry. We know `GrownIn(cherry, benSYard)` from premise 5, and we just derived `Is(cherry, apple)`. The antecedent is true, so by modus ponens, we must conclude `RedFruit(cherry)` is true.
4.  This contradicts our initial assumption in step 1. Therefore, by proof by contradiction, `RedFruit(cherry)` must be true.

Now that we have established `RedFruit(cherry)` is true, we can proceed:

5.  From premise 1, `∀x ((GrownIn(x, benSYard) ∧ RedFruit(x)) → Contain(x, vitaminC))`. Since we know `GrownIn(cherry, benSYard)` (premise 5) and we proved `RedFruit(cherry)`, we can conclude `Contain(cherry, vitaminC)` is true.
6.  From premise 3, `∀x ((GrownIn(x, benSYard) ∧ Contain(x, vitaminC)) → healthy(x))`. Since `GrownIn(cherry, benSYard)` is true and we just proved `Contain(cherry, vitaminC)` is true, we can conclude `Healthy(cherry)` is true.
7.  From premise 4, `∀x ((GrownIn(x, benSYard) ∧ Healthy(x)) → ¬On(x, warningList))`. Since `GrownIn(cherry, benSYard)` is true and we just proved `Healthy(cherry)` is true, we can conclude `¬On(cherry, warningList)` is true. This means `On(cherry, warningList)` is false.

Finally, let's evaluate the conclusion: `Contain(cherry, vitaminC) ⊕ On(cherry, warningList)`.
- We proved `Contain(cherry, vitaminC)` is true.
- We proved `On(cherry, warningList)` is false.
- `True ⊕ False` evaluates to True.

From premise 6, `¬(Healthy(cherry) ∧ Is(cherry, apple)) → RedFruit(cherry)`, we can deduce that `RedFruit(cherry)` must be true. This is because if the antecedent is true, `RedFruit(cherry)` is true by modus ponens. If the antecedent is false (meaning `Healthy(cherry) ∧ Is(cherry, apple)` is true), then `Is(cherry, apple)` is true. From premise 2, `∀x (GrownIn(x, benSYard) ∧ Is(x, apple) → RedFruit(x))`, and premise 5, `GrownIn(cherry, benSYard)`, we can again conclude `RedFruit(cherry)` is true. Therefore, `RedFruit(cherry)` is always true.

2. Since `RedFruit(cherry)` is true, the consequent of the conclusion, `¬RedFruit(cherry)`, is definitively False.

3. An implication `A → B` can only be true if B is false when A is also false. So we must check if the antecedent of the conclusion, `(BeneficialTo(cherry, people) ⊕ On(cherry, warningList))`, is always false.

4. Since we established `RedFruit(cherry)` is true, we can use the other premises. With `GrownIn(cherry, benSYard)` (P5), `RedFruit(cherry)` implies `Contain(cherry, vitaminC)` (P1), which implies `Healthy(cherry)` (P3), which in turn implies `¬On(cherry, warningList)` (P4). So, `On(cherry, warningList)` is definitively False.

5. Substituting `On(cherry, warningList) = False` into the antecedent gives us `(BeneficialTo(cherry, people) ⊕ False)`. The XOR operator `(P ⊕ False)` simplifies to just `P`. So the antecedent simplifies to `BeneficialTo(cherry, people)`.

6. The entire conclusion now simplifies to `BeneficialTo(cherry, people) → False`.

7. The premises provide no information about the predicate `BeneficialTo`. It is possible for `BeneficialTo(cherry, people)` to be true in a world consistent with the premises. In such a world, the conclusion becomes `True → False`, which is a False statement. Since the conclusion is not true in all possible interpretations of the premises, it is not a logical truth."

To test this, we can assume one of the conditions in the 'if' part is true and see if the 'then' part follows. Let's assume the cherries are red. According to the premises: 1. The cherries grow in Ben's yard. 2. All red fruits that grow in Ben's yard contain some Vitamin C. From these, it follows that if the cherries are red, they MUST contain Vitamin C. 3. All fruits in Ben's yard that contain Vitamin C are healthy. From this, it follows that if the cherries contain Vitamin C, they MUST be healthy. Therefore, the assumption that 'the cherries are red' leads to the deduction that they ARE healthy and DO contain Vitamin C. This directly contradicts the conclusion's claim that they would be 'not healthy and do not contain any amount of vitamin C'. Since a part of the premise of the conclusion leads to the opposite of its outcome, the conclusion is logically false.","The conclusion's validity can be tested by finding a counterexample where all premises are true, but the conclusion is false. For the conclusion '(A ⊕ B) → C' to be false, the antecedent '(On(cherry, warningList) ⊕ RedFruit(cherry))' must be true, and the consequent '¬(BeneficialTo(cherry, people) ∧ Contain(cherry, vitaminC))' must be false. The consequent being false implies that 'BeneficialTo(cherry, people)' is true and 'Contain(cherry, vitaminC)' is true. The predicate 'BeneficialTo' is not mentioned in the premises, so we can assume it is true without contradiction. If 'Contain(cherry, vitaminC)' is true and 'GrownIn(cherry, benSYard)' is true (Premise 5), then by Premise 3, 'healthy(cherry)' is true. If 'healthy(cherry)' is true, then by Premise 4, '¬On(cherry, warningList)' is true, meaning 'On(cherry, warningList)' is false. For the antecedent of the conclusion to be true, '(False ⊕ RedFruit(cherry))' must be true, which requires 'RedFruit(cherry)' to be true. This assignment of truth values (e.g., RedFruit=True, OnWarningList=False, ContainVitaminC=True, Healthy=True, BeneficialTo=True) makes all premises true while making the conclusion false (True → False). Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises."

A premise states a person with a high income will not take a bus. Since people either take a bus or drive, James must drive. In both possible cases derived from the premises, James drives to his destination. The conclusion is 'James drives to his destination or he is a student'. Since we have established that 'James drives to his destination' is true, the entire 'or' statement is logically true, regardless of whether he is a student or not.","The conclusion contains a free variable 'x', which is likely a typo for 'james'. Assuming the conclusion is 'MeansToDestination(james, drive) ∨ Student(james)', we can proceed with the analysis. The sixth premise provides a disjunction: 'HaveCar(james) ∨ WorkAt(james, meta)'. We must analyze both cases.

Case 1: Assume 'HaveCar(james)' is true. From premise 4 ('∀x (HaveCar(x) → MeansToDestination(x, drive))'), it follows that 'MeansToDestination(james, drive)' is true.

Case 2: Assume 'WorkAt(james, meta)' is true. From premise 1, 'HighIncome(james)' is true. From premise 2, '¬MeansToDestination(james, bus)' is true. From premise 3, which is an exclusive OR, if James does not take the bus, he must drive. Therefore, 'MeansToDestination(james, drive)' is true.

In both possible cases, 'MeansToDestination(james, drive)' is true. If the first part of a disjunction ('OR' statement) is true, the entire statement is true. Thus, 'MeansToDestination(james, drive) ∨ Student(james)' is logically true."

Since people either take a bus or drive, James must drive. In both possible cases, the outcome is that James drives to his destination.

For the conclusion to be a decidable proposition, 'x' must be interpreted as 'james'. Thus, we analyze the conclusion: 'MeansToDestination(james, drive) ⊕ Student(james)'. This means 'Either James drives or James is a student, but not both'.
The premises provide 'HaveCar(james) ∨ WorkAt(james, meta)', which gives us two cases to consider.

Case 1: Assume 'HaveCar(james)' is true.
From '∀x (HaveCar(x) → MeansToDestination(x, drive))', we can infer 'MeansToDestination(james, drive)' is true.
From '∀x (Student(x) → ¬ MeansToDestination(x, drive))', by contraposition, we get 'MeansToDestination(james, drive) → ¬Student(james)'. Since we know 'MeansToDestination(james, drive)' is true, it follows that '¬Student(james)' is true, meaning 'Student(james)' is false.
Evaluating the conclusion: 'MeansToDestination(james, drive) ⊕ Student(james)' becomes 'True ⊕ False', which is True.

Case 2: Assume 'WorkAt(james, meta)' is true.
From '∀x (WorkAt(x, meta) → HighIncome(x))', we infer 'HighIncome(james)'.
From '∀x (HighIncome(x) → ¬MeansToDestination(x, bus))', we infer '¬MeansToDestination(james, bus)'.
From '∀x (MeansToDestination(x, bus) ⊕ MeansToDestination(x, drive))', since 'MeansToDestination(james, bus)' is false, 'MeansToDestination(james, drive)' must be true.
As in Case 1, this implies '¬Student(james)' is true, so 'Student(james)' is false.
Evaluating the conclusion: 'MeansToDestination(james, drive) ⊕ Student(james)' becomes 'True ⊕ False', which is True.

Since both possible scenarios derived from the premises lead to the conclusion being true, the conclusion is logically sound."
