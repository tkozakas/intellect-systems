Case 1: Assume Rina is unaware that caffeine is a drug.
If this is true, then the second part of the conclusion (""is unaware that caffeine is a drug"") is true. This makes the entire 'OR' statement true.

Case 2: Assume Rina is NOT unaware that caffeine is a drug (meaning she is aware).
- According to Premise 4, if she is aware, she is not a student.
- According to Premise 5, if she is not a student, she is not dependent on caffeine.
- According to Premise 1, since she is not dependent on caffeine, she does not regularly drink coffee.
- According to Premise 2, since she does not regularly drink coffee, it must be true that she doesn't want to be addicted to caffeine.
- This makes the first part of the conclusion (""Rina doesn't want to be addicted to caffeine..."") true. This makes the entire 'OR' statement true.

In both possible scenarios derived from the premises, the conclusion is true. Therefore, the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises.",True,"Let's represent the predicates for Rina as follows:
DR = DrinkRegularly(rina, coffee)
ID = IsDependentOn(rina, caffeine)
¬WTA = ¬WantToBeAddictedTo(rina, caffeine)
¬AD = ¬AwareThatDrug(rina, caffeine)
S = Student(rina)

The premises for Rina are:
1. DR → ID
2. DR ∨ ¬WTA
3. ¬WTA → ¬AD
4. ¬(S ⊕ ¬AD)  which is equivalent to S ↔ ¬AD
5. ¬(ID ⊕ S) which is equivalent to ID ↔ S

The conclusion is: ¬WTA ∨ ¬AD

From premises 4 and 5, by the transitivity of the biconditional (↔), we can deduce: ID ↔ ¬AD.

Now, let's use proof by cases based on premise 2 (DR ∨ ¬WTA):

Case 1: Assume ¬WTA is true.
If ¬WTA is true, then by the rule of disjunction introduction, the conclusion (¬WTA ∨ ¬AD) is automatically true.

Case 2: Assume DR is true.
- From premise 1 (DR → ID), if DR is true, then ID must be true.
- From our earlier deduction (ID ↔ ¬AD), if ID is true, then ¬AD must also be true.
- If ¬AD is true, then by the rule of disjunction introduction, the conclusion (¬WTA ∨ ¬AD) is automatically true.

Since the conclusion holds in both possible cases derived from premise 2, the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises."

¬(IsDependentOn(rina, caffeine) ⊕ Student(rina))","¬WantToBeAddictedTo(rina, caffeine) ⊕ ¬AwareThatDrug(rina, caffeine)",True,True,"Let's analyze the premises step-by-step.
1. Premise 4 says Rina is a student if and only if she is unaware that caffeine is a drug. 
2. Premise 5 says Rina is a student if and only if she is dependent on caffeine.
3. From (1) and (2), we can conclude that Rina is unaware that caffeine is a drug if and only if she is dependent on caffeine.

Now, let's test the conclusion by assuming its opposite is true: ""Rina wants to be addicted to caffeine AND she is aware that caffeine is a drug.""

4. If Rina is aware that caffeine is a drug (the second part of our assumption), then according to our deduction in (3), she must NOT be dependent on caffeine.
5. According to Premise 1, if she is not dependent on caffeine, she does not regularly drink coffee.
6. According to Premise 2, Rina either regularly drinks coffee OR she doesn't want to be addicted to caffeine.
7. Since we deduced in (5) that she does not regularly drink coffee, she MUST not want to be addicted to caffeine for Premise 2 to be true.
8. This creates a contradiction: our initial assumption stated that Rina *wants* to be addicted, but our logical deduction concludes she *doesn't want* to be addicted. 

Because assuming the opposite of the conclusion leads to a contradiction, the original conclusion must be true.",False,"Let's denote the propositions for rina as follows:
C = DrinkRegularly(rina, coffee)
D = IsDependentOn(rina, caffeine)
W = WantToBeAddictedTo(rina, caffeine)
A = AwareThatDrug(rina, caffeine)
S = Student(rina)

The premises for rina are:
1. C → D
2. C ∨ ¬W
3. ¬W → ¬A
4. ¬(S ⊕ ¬A), which is equivalent to S ↔ ¬A
5. ¬(D ⊕ S), which is equivalent to D ↔ S

The conclusion to be evaluated is: ¬W ⊕ ¬A

From premises (4) and (5), by transitivity of the biconditional (↔), we can deduce D ↔ ¬A.

From the other premises, we can form a chain of implications:
- From (3), by contraposition: A → W
- From (2), which is equivalent to ¬C → ¬W, by contraposition: W → C
- From (1): C → D
Combining these, we get the chain: A → W → C → D, which simplifies to A → D.

Now we have two derived facts: (i) A → D and (ii) D ↔ ¬A.
Let's combine them. A → D is logically equivalent to ¬A ∨ D. Since D ↔ ¬A, we can substitute ¬A for D in the expression. This gives us ¬A ∨ ¬A, which simplifies to ¬A.
Thus, the premises logically imply that ¬A must be true.

Now we evaluate the conclusion: ¬W ⊕ ¬A.
Since we have established ¬A is True, the conclusion becomes ¬W ⊕ True.
The truth value of this expression depends on the truth value of ¬W:
- If ¬W is True, then True ⊕ True is False.
- If ¬W is False, then False ⊕ True is True.

To determine if the conclusion is logically true, we must see if the premises force ¬W to be False. The premises constraining ¬W are (2) C ∨ ¬W and (3) ¬W → ¬A. Since we know ¬A is True, (3) becomes ¬W → True, which is always true and gives no information about ¬W. This leaves us with (2) C ∨ ¬W. The premises do not determine the truth values of C or ¬W, only that they cannot both be false. 

We can construct a model where all premises are true but the conclusion is false. Let ¬W be True. To satisfy C ∨ ¬W, we can let C be False. We already know ¬A is True. 
Let's check this model: ¬A=True, ¬W=True, C=False, D=True, S=True.
- P1: C → D (F → T) is True.
- P2: C ∨ ¬W (F ∨ T) is True.
- P3: ¬W → ¬A (T → T) is True.
- P4: S ↔ ¬A (T ↔ T) is True.
- P5: D ↔ S (T ↔ T) is True.
All premises are satisfied.
However, the conclusion ¬W ⊕ ¬A becomes True ⊕ True, which is False.

Since there is a valid assignment of truth values under which all premises are true and the conclusion is false, the conclusion is not a logical consequence of the premises. Therefore, the conclusion is not logically True."
